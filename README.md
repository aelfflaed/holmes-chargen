# holmes-chargen
Random Holmes Basic D&amp;D character generator.

This creates a random, level 1 character using the 1977 Holmes Basic D&D rules.
I've added Halfling thieves (using Greyhawk racial bonuses), but all else is by-the-book.
The framework and data is there for generating levels 1-3, but Elves present some difficulty.
That is on the to-do list.

Depends on Tie::IxHash (Debian/Ubuntu package libtie-ixhash-perl, 
Red Hat/Centos perl-Tie-IxHash)
